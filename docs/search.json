    "text": "Students from the Software for Social Good VIP team at Virginia Commonwealth University designed, developed and deployed a report automation tool that streamlines the creation of custom Powerpoint slide decks.\nThe tool consists of two primary subsystems: a backend that runs on a Windows machine connected to the company-internal network, and a frontend that runs on an employee’s web browser. Employees complete a form on their browser and submit it to the backend for processing. The backend creates a custom Powerpoint presentation using data provided by the employee, and pushes the newly created Powerpoint back to the employee, ready to share and present.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe Software for Social Good team would like to extend our deep appreciation to Shawn Gibson of Overlay Shares and Liquid Strategies LLC for their generous gift that funded this project.\nThrough their financial support and team mentoring, we gained invaluable project management and software engineering experience through designing, developing and deploying a software tool for a financial services company. The students gained practice using powerful data science tools including Quarto, Python and Git."

Employees provide background information about the client and the portfolio size using a web browser. The tool generates a PPTX and returns it through the browser to the employee. The employee can then modify the PPTX and share it with the client and or customer.\nThe system consists of two major parts: a back-end that runs on a windows machine connected to the company internal network, and a front-end that runs on a employees browser."
